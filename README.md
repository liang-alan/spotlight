This is SpotLight!

SpotLight is an App created for the Empower2.0 2024 Hackathon for the Kinetik SonicBids Live Music Directory & Professional Network Web App track.

I chose to participate in this track because of my love for music. Over this past year, I have been consistenly reteaching myself how to play the piano. I also love to create "remixes" of songs as well as some of my own songs on my freetime as well. I believe music is powerful and its amazing to see how unifying music can be.

Spotlight is an app focused on giving the "spotlight" to smaller artists who are looking for events and other gigs. It gives artists an oppurtunity to search for events, connect with others, and create a visually stunning EPK.

This was created using Google Firebase, React + Vite, as well as many useful libraries such as
    - React BootStrap
    - React Icons (FontAwesome)
    - React Router
    - Framer
    - Google Maps API

Thank you for looking at my project!
